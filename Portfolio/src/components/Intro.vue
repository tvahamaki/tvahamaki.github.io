        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">I am a programmer, problem solver and generalist developer with a strong passion for games. I have been making and modding games for as long as I can remember and coding since the age of 11. I have taught myself to do it all from gameplay code, art and sound design to even writing my own game engines and renderers. I studied game development in Metropolia UAS and graduated in 2020.</p>
        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">Over the last few years my professional life has steered me towards AI and machine learning, where I have quickly become well versed in finding creative solutions to problems that may have been impossible to solve before.</p>
        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">I am currently working as CTO at EvokAI Creative Labs, where I am leading the development of a comprehensive AI-powered platform for brain health, using gamified solutions as data sources.</p>
