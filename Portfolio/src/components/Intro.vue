        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">I am a programmer, problem solver and generalist developer with a strong passion for games. I started programming games when I was 11 years old and taught myself to do it all from gameplay code, art and sound design to even writing my own game engines and 3D renderers. I studied ICT and game development in Metropolia UAS and graduated in 2020.</p>
        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">Over the last few years my professional projects have steered me towards AI and machine learning, where I have quickly become well versed in finding creative solutions to problems that may have been impossible to solve before.</p>
        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">I am currently working as CTO and lead developer at EvokAI Creative Labs, where I am working on a comprehensive AI-powered platform for brain health, using gamified solutions as data sources.</p>
