        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">I am a programmer, problem solver and generalist developer with a background in games, AI and medical technology. I have helped solve a wide variety of technical challenges while working on projects such as Rehaboo's AI-powered exercise game and EvokAI's data platform for brain health. I learned to code when I was 11 years old by making games, custom game engines and 3D renderers. I built a strong set of core skills, allowing me to learn new technologies quickly and tackle complex problems with confidence.</p>
        <p class="px-8 py-4 text-justify">I am currently working as CTO and lead developer at EvokAI Creative Labs, where I am working on multiple medtech products with a focus on AI and data. These products include gamified solutions, simulations and sensors.</p>
