        <Project image="active.jpg" title="Rehaboo! Active" text="Rehaboo Active is an innovative exercise game for workplaces, hospitals and elderly care. At Rehaboo I was a generalist game developer with a focus on technology and AI. I designed a motion control system based on computer vision that made it possible to replace Kinect with a standard webcam. This allows the game to run on laptops, smartphones or any smart device with a camera. I was also responsible for the development of Rehaboo's cloud computing architecture and optimizing the game for mobile." />
        <Project flip image="neurocar.jpg" title="Neurocar" text="I am the lead developer of EvokAI's Neurocar project - a simulator and driving test platform designed to gather large amounts of cognitive and behavioural data. It is used by hospitals and vocational schools to assess a person's attention, risk-taking behaviour and ability to perform in certain professions." />
        <Project image="mobile.jpeg" title="Evok.eye" text="All of EvokAI's products gather vital data about the user's cognitive health. A comprehensive AI-powered data platform was designed to gather all of EvokAI's data into one place, where the user or their doctor can easily monitor progress. AI-powered tools within Evok.eye can be used to make predictions and summaries of the user's cognitive well-being. This platform is currently in development and I am working on all aspects of it from UI/UX to data analysis and full-stack development." />
